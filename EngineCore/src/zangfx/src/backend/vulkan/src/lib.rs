//! ZanGFX Vulkan Backend â€” Implements a ZanGFX backend using the Vulkan API.
//!
//! Vulkan is one of the primary target APIs of ZanGFX as well as its
//! predecessor, NgsGFX. For this reason, ZanGFX is designed to run efficiently
//! on Vulkan.
//!
//! # Inter-queue operations
//!
//! This backend supports inter-queue operations.
//!
//! # Backend-specific behaviors
//!
//! *Default queue*: The base interface specifies that how the default value of
//! `*Builder::queue` is determined is backend-dependent. In this backend,
//! `Device` maintains the default queue to be used during object creation. The
//! first created `CmdQueue` from it will be used as the default unless it is
//! explicitly specified via [`crate::device::Device::set_default_queue`]. If
//! there is no default value set at the point when it is required (i.e., when
//! a builder's `build` is called), a dummy value that is not associated with
//! any queue will be used instead.
//!
//! # Unsafety
//!
//! This backend implementation is known to cause an undefined behavior
//! (including compromising the memory safety and integrity otherwise provided
//! by Rust), mainly due to an incorrect usage of the Vulkan API, in the
//! situations including (but not limited to) the following:
//!
//!  - Using objects that originate from a different `VkDevice`.
//!  - Uses of uninitialized argument tables.
//!  - Uses of already destroyed argument tables.
//!  - Updating argument tables which are referenced by any pending command
//!    buffers.
//!  - Specifying parameters exceeding the hardware limitation indicated by
//!    `DeviceLimits`
//!  - Uses of invalid SPIRV code.
//!  - Out-of-bounds buffer accesses. The `robustBufferAccess` feature can be
//!    used to make them safe when buffers are accessed from shader code.
//!  - Out-of-bounds image accesses.
//!  - Doing queue ownership transfer operations improperly.
//!  - Not calling `use_resource_core` when you have to.
//!  - Simultaneous accesses to an image layer via a render target and a shader
//!    argument at the same time.
//!  - Incompatibility between a root signature and shader.
//!
//! ## Rust undefined behaviors
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//!  - The number of argument tables per root signature is limited to 32
//!    (`MAX_NUM_ARG_TABLES`).
//!  - The number of referenced resources per command buffer is limited to
//!    around 4 billions.
//!

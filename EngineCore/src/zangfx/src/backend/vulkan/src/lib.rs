//! ZanGFX Vulkan Backend â€” Implements a ZanGFX backend using the Vulkan API.
//!
//! Vulkan is one of the primary target APIs of ZanGFX as well as its
//! predecessor, NgsGFX. For this reason, ZanGFX is designed to run efficiently
//! on Vulkan.
//!
//! # Inter-queue operations
//!
//! This backend supports inter-queue operations.
//!
//! ## Backend-specific behaviors
//!
//! *Default queue*: The base interface specifies that how the default value of
//! `*Builder::queue` is determined is backend-dependent. In this backend,
//! `Device` maintains the default queue to be used during object creation. The
//! first created `CmdQueue` from it will be used as the default unless it is
//! explicitly specified via [`crate::device::Device::set_default_queue`]. If
//! there is no default value set at the point when it is required (i.e., when
//! a builder's `build` is called), a panic will occur.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//!  - The number of argument tables per root signature is limited to 32
//!    (`MAX_NUM_ARG_TABLES`).
//!  - The number of referenced resources per command buffer is limited to
//!    around 4 billions.
//!

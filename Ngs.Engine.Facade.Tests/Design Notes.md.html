**Ngs.Engine.Facade.Tests Design Notes**

This project contains xUnit tests for `Ngs.Engine.Facade`.

- The directory structure does not follow the standard convention by design.
  A test class `Ngs.Foo.Tests.Bar` would be placed in `Foo/Bar.cs`.
- Since the tests requires an access to the engine core, the environment
  variable `NGS_ENGINE_PATH` must be set appropriately.
- Some of the tests might fail without GUI access.

//! NgsGFX Metal Backend
//! ====================
//!
//! Implements a NgsGFX backend using Apple's Metal API.
//!
//! Metal is one of the primary target APIs of NgsGFX. This is why large portions
//! of NgsGFX's API resemble that of Metal.
//!
//! Feature Mappings
//! ----------------
//!
//!  - **`UniversalHeap`** - Naturally mapped to non-heap resource allocations.
//!  - **`SpecializedHeap`** - Unavailable. The dummy implementation behaves
//!    mostly like `UniversalHeap`.
//!
//!    Metal 2 that comes with macOS 10.13 introduces `MTLHeap`.
//!    `SpecializedHeap` might be implemented using `MTLHeap` eventually.
//!  - **`Event`** - Mapped to callbacks from `MTLCommandBuffer`.
//!  - **`Fence`** - Currently no-op. Will be mapped to `MTLFence` eventually.
//!  - **`CommandBuffer`** - Naturally mapped to `MTLCommandBuffer`.
//!    The concept of `DeviceEngine` does not exist in Metal, so it is just ignored.
//!  - **`RenderPass`** - Each subpass is mapped to a Metal render pass. We could leverage the tile
//!    local storage by merging multiple subpasses into one, but no known macOS version supports
//!    this, so we stick to the na√Øve approach.
//!  - **`DescriptorSet`** - Flattened to argument tables.
//!
//! ### Unimplemented Features
//!
//! The following to-do list is not comprehensive.
//!
//!  - Exception handling - Out of device/host memory will result in an undefined behavior.
//!    This is supposed to return a `Err` value or cause a panic.
//!  - Device lost handling - I just do not know what will go wrong.
//!  - Some shader instructions - SPIR-V shaders are translated into MSL using the modified version of SPIRV-Cross,
//!    but not the entire set of instructions are supported. For example, memory barrier instructions
//!    are currently ignored because the direct counterparts do not exist in MSL. Memory barriers are crucial
//!    in compute shaders, so control barrier instructions were modified to generate memory barriers as well.
//!    This work-around might be removed in the future if we could find a way to implement memory barriers correctly.
//!    To ensure the future compatibility, use the following GLSL snippet to place a work-group memory/control
//!    barrier:
//!
//!    ```glsl
//!    groupMemoryBarrier();    // OpMemoryBarrier - no MSL counterparts available
//!    barrier();               // OpControlBarrier - mapped to workgroup_barrier(...)
//!    ```

//
//! NgsGFX Metal Backend
//! ====================
//!
//! Feature Mappings
//! ----------------
//!
//!  - **`Heap`** - A manually managed heap is available (`MTLHeap`), but is not supported
//!    on macOS (yet?). Since we are targetting desktop platforms, no implementations that make
//!    use of `MTLHeap` are provided. TODO: Metal 2 supports `MTLHeap` on both of macOS and iOS
//!
//!    `MTLBuffer` provides a method that allows users to sub-allocate its portion to create
//!    texture views, but this is inappropriate for a general use since it is not designed for
//!    performance but rather a way to create linearly layouted textures.
//!  - **`Event`** - Mapped to callbacks from `MTLCommandBuffer`.
//!  - **`BufferView`** - No direct Metal counterparts are available. TODO: emulate by 2D texture?
//!  - **`CommandBuffer`** - Maps naturally to Metal except that one `CommandBuffer` can have multiple
//!    subpasses, each of which is mapped to a `MTLRenderPassDescriptor`.
//!  - **`RenderPass`** - Each subpass is mapped to a Metal render pass. We could leverage the tile
//!    local storage by merging multiple subpasses into one, but no known macOS version supports
//!    this, so we stick to the na√Øve approach.
//!  - **`DescriptorSet`** - Flattened to argument tables. TODO: make use of Metal 2's
//!    indirect argument tables for more efficiency
//!
//! ### Unimplemented Features
//!
//!  - Exception handling - Out of memory will result in an undefined behavior.
//!    This is supposed to cause a panic.

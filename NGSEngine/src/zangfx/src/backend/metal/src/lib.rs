//! ZanGFX Metal Backend â€” Implements a ZanGFX backend using Apple's Metal 2 API.
//!
//! Metal is one of the primary target APIs of ZanGFX as well as its
//! predecessor, NgsGFX. For this reason, ZanGFX is designed to run efficiently
//! on Metal.
//!
//! # Implementation Details
//!
//! ## Ownership of raw pointers
//!
//! Metal objects require manual reference counting using `[NSObject retain]`
//! and `[NSObject release]`. When dealing with ref-counted objects, it is
//! crucial to maintain the ownership properly. In general, this crate follows
//! the pattern shown below:
//!
//!  - Methods named `new` increases the reference count when receiving an
//!    object, thus creating a new strong reference.
//!  - Conversely, methods named `from_raw` do not increase the reference count.
//!  - No method increases the reference count when returning an object.

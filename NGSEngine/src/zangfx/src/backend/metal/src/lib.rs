//! ZanGFX Metal Backend â€” Implements a ZanGFX backend using Apple's Metal 2 API.
//!
//! Metal is one of the primary target APIs of ZanGFX as well as its
//! predecessor, NgsGFX. For this reason, ZanGFX is designed to run efficiently
//! on Metal.
//!
//! # Implementation Details
//!
//! ## Ownership of raw pointers
//!
//! Metal objects require manual reference counting using `[NSObject retain]`
//! and `[NSObject release]`. When dealing with ref-counted objects, it is
//! crucial to maintain the ownership properly. In general, this crate follows
//! the pattern shown below:
//!
//!  - Methods named `new` increases the reference count when receiving an
//!    object, thus creating a new strong reference.
//!  - Conversely, methods named `from_raw` do not increase the reference count.
//!  - No method increases the reference count when returning an object.
//!
//! # Performance Quirks
//!
//! Due to Metal's restrictions, `Heap` uses an emulated implementation for a
//! heap placed in a shared memory that does not use `MTLHeap`. As a result,
//! `use_heap` runs much slower for such heaps. In general, you should avoid
//! referencing shared resources through argument tables since their performance
//! is lower than private resources.
//!
//! # Debugging
//!
//! Setting labels is supported by the following objects: `ArgPoolBuilder`,
//! `CmdBuffer`, `CmdQueueBuilder`, `BufferBuilder`, `ImageBuilder`,
//! `HeapBuilder`, `ComputePipelineBuilder`, `SamplerBuilder`, and
//! `LibraryBuilder`.
//! Labels are visible via a debugger interface, for example, Xcode's GPU Frame
//! Capture.
//!
//! All command encoders support debug commands (`begin_debug_group`,
//! `end_debug_group`, and `insert_debug_marker`). They are mapped to
//! `MTLCommandEncoder`'s methods and they are visible via Xcode's GPU Frame
//! Capture.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! ## Shaders
//!
//! - SPIRV-Cross does not adhere to the array base alignment rule as defined by
//!   the standard uniform buffer layout yet. It is advised that you only use
//!   16-byte aligned types (e.g., `vec4` or structs containing one) as element
//!   types for arrays defined in uniform buffers.
//!
